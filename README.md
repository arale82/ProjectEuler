## Projects realized

In the project directory, you can find the projects I solved:

### Multiples of 3 or 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3,5,6 and 10. 
      The sum of these multiples is 23.

      Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1
      and 2, the first terms will be: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89 ...

      By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Largest Prime Factor

What is the largest prime factor of a number.

### Largest Palindrome Product

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

### Smallest Multiple

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20.

### Sum Square Difference

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

### 10001st Prime

What is the 10000st prime number?
